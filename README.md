## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* 90,398 roles will need to be filled once the “silver tsunami” of employees aging-out of the workforce hits. 
* In the context of the entire company, the total employee count is 300,024. This means leaders at Pewlett Hackard should expect a baseline employee turnover of 30%, just from employees who are retirement-eligible and will need to be replaced with new hires.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
* No. The number of eligible mentors is less than 2% of the upcoming 90,398 vacant positions from retiring employees. 
* For every 1 mentor there will be roughly 58 vacant positions being filled by new employees that will need a mentor. 
* An ideal ratio mentor:mentee (i.e., new hire) would be in the single digits - between 1:3 and 1:5.
